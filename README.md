### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Khalid Hourani. I am a PhD student studying computer science at the University of Houston. My areas of research are algorithms, big data, and high-performance computing. My favorite programming languages are Python and Rust, though I primarily use LaTeX and C++ in my work.
